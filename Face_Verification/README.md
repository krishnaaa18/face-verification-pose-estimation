# Face Verification & Head Pose Estimation 🔍📐

This project performs **face verification** using DeepFace and **head pose estimation** using MediaPipe & OpenCV. It compares two face images to verify if they belong to the same person and calculates head orientation angles (Yaw, Pitch, Roll) from 2D image inputs.
